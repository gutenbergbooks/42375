<h2 class="p6">FOREWORD</h2>

<p>The study presented here was one of a series planned by
Professor Lila M. O'Neale, Associate Curator of Textiles in
the Museum of Anthropology. The fundamental idea was to
make use of the wealth of material in the collections of the
Museum of Anthropology, particularly its pre-Columbian
Peruvian textiles, as source material for study and analysis
by advanced students. Professor O'Neale's sudden death on
February 2, 1948, means that, although the paper was completed
and in the hands of the Board of Editors of Anthropological
Records, the final proofreading has not been done by
Professor O'Neale.</p>

<p>The Board greatly regrets that this outstanding contribution
will not be followed by others produced under the direction
and guidance of a highly esteemed colleague.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>This study of the Chincha plain-weave materials in
the Max Uhle collection of the University of California
has been part of the work of a Senior course in technical
analysis. Six members of the class, whose names appear
as joint authors, are responsible for the data collected
and for the initial organization.</p>

<h3>The Material</h3>

<p>The Chincha collection, excavated in 1900 by Dr. Max
Uhle during the Peruvian expedition financed by Mrs.
Phoebe Apperson Hearst, is catalogued under two lot
prefixes: 4- and 16-. Specimen numbers with the prefix
4- indicate that the precise provenience as to site and
grave is known. The cloths in this lot have been previously
analyzed and a preliminary report has been
published.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The cloths in the 16- lot, as is explained in
the report on the pottery,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> did not identify perfectly
with entries in the collector's field catalogue or their
identification was dubious.</p>

<p>Six Chincha sites described in Uhle's field catalogue<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
are shown on <a href="#i_006">map 1</a>. The number of cloth specimens
representing each of these sites varies from 2 to 52
(<a href="#table1">table 1</a>). Briefly, the time periods indicated by finds
forming the basis of this report are as follows.</p>

<p>Site A (2 specimens). "On the declivities of the valley
towards the sea, 5 km. from Tambo de Mora to the
north." Late Chincha period.</p>

<p>Site B (3 specimens). La Cumbe cemetery; nearly
exhausted; the few graves opened were "ordinary ones."
Late Chincha period.</p>

<p>Site C (37 specimens). In "the higher Northern part
of the valley." Late Chincha period.</p>

<p>Site D, and "near" site D (52 specimens). "Chamberlike
tombs, which had been dug out in a mound-like older
huaca." Late Chincha period.</p>

<p>Site E, and "near" site E (20 specimens). "The dry
natural terrace ... in front of the ruins of La Centinela."
Several graves at this site held European articles. Late
Chincha period, in part after the Spanish Conquest.</p>

<p>Site F (2 specimens). "The natural terraces with
slopes directed to the sea north of La Cumbe (circa
Las Palmas)."<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Late Chincha period.</p>

<p>Most of the fabrics described in the literature on ancient
Peruvian textiles are characterized by beauty of
coloring or arresting designs or unusual workmanship&mdash;sometimes
by all three. These all-cotton Chincha specimens
have none of the expectable features. First and last
they seem to have served utilitarian purposes; for that
reason, most of them are comparable to our so-called
domestics. The larger ones are probably mantles: the
proportions of the largest two-breadth pieces with full
dimensions (4-3973d, 59.5 in. by 66 in. and 16-1250, 52
in. by 61 in.) place them in this group; a third specimen
(16-1292), also formed of two breadths (intact breadth
35 in. plus fragmentary breadth 28 in.) was probably a
mantle 62 inches by 70 inches over all. The smaller
specimens suggest scarves (or incomplete mantles),
carrying cloths, or kerchiefs (figs. <a href="#i_010">1</a>, <a href="#i_011">2</a>).</p>

<p>The fact that many of the Chincha cloths in the 16- lot
had apparently been roughly torn to rectangular shapes
leads us to believe that the excavator used them to wrap
pottery specimens. Indeed, the majority seem to have
been used even by their makers as wrappings. A number
of them have long loose stitches or hanging cordlike
threads, which originally may have held several layers
together. Many of the single breadths have traces of seaming
stitches on one or both selvages, indicating that the
original wrapping was two or three times its preserved
width.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>A large proportion of the cloths in this group are badly
worn and clumsily patched. Two, three, and sometimes
more pieces of irregular shape applied to the base material
and even on top of a first patch are not infrequent
(<a href="#i_063">pl. 3</a>,<i>d</i>). The mended fragments do not appear to be
either the original sizes or shapes. Many of them have
been reduced to their present rectangular shape by tearing
off tattered (?) edges.</p>

<p>One small group of striped textiles in the 16- lot is a
noteworthy exception to the majority. Finely striped cottons
similar to the one in <a href="#i_065">plate 5</a>,<i>d</i> must certainly have
been made for other than utility cloths, probably for garments.</p>

<p>There are four small bags (or pads?) in the Chincha
4- lot. Three of these were formed of small whole cloths
sewed together at the sides with running, double running,
and whipping stitches respectively. The fourth is made of
a piece of an edge-stripe material and has one loomstring
end and one side selvage. On this bag the torn edges have
been turned in and seamed with a running stitch.</p>

<p>Ties for one of the bags have been made by plaiting in
a 4-strand flat braid the elements consisting of the two
loomstrings plus an additional 12-ply cord drawn through
the corner of the bag to its center point, thus giving two
ends. Another of the bags has a draw string formed by a
9-ply cord drawn through the top end with a running stitch.</p>

<h2>DIMENSIONS OF THE CHINCHA CLOTHS</h2>

<p>One hundred twelve cloths in the plain-weave group
were measured. Because some of the specimens could not
be placed under tension, the forefinger was drawn along
the cloth beside a steel tape to smooth out wrinkles. Measurements
taken by this method approximate those on a
cloth stretched between the bars of a loom.</p>

<h3>Lengths</h3>

<p>Complete dimensions can be taken on eighteen Chincha
specimens in lots 4- and 16-. As figures <a href="#i_010">1</a> and <a href="#i_011">2</a> show,
these dimensions cluster around two sets of proportions:
the eleven cloths represented in the diagram in <a href="#i_010">figure 1</a>
are squarish; the seven in <a href="#i_011">figure 2</a>, with a length-to-width
proportion of approximately two-to-three to one,
are rectangular. Four of the squarish cloths are formed
of two separately woven breadths of material. All the
rectangular cloths are single breadths.</p>

<p>Measurements of these specimens with complete dimensions
are given below under the two classifications.</p>

<p>From the twenty Chincha plain-weave cloths with
intact lengths (<a href="#i_019">fig. 4</a>) it is possible to know (1) that the
cloths were woven by methods standard among the ancient
Peruvians; (2) that each breadth represents a
separate warping operation which established its ultimate
length; (3) that each breadth was made singly on
the loom. The evidence for such procedures and the
identifying features of the end selvages on Peruvian
cloths are to be recognized in the continuous thread which
forms the warp skein&mdash;in contradistinction to cut ends
of warps&mdash;and in the presence of two or more heavy
wefts, the first ones put across the web. The cords binding
the end loops of the warp skein to the loom bars hold
the first of these loomstring wefts, as they are called, to
the bars. The two or more succeeding wefts, which are
interlaced with the warps, establish the width of the piece
and give it a certain firmness. On the ends of some cloths
the strand of cord for loomstrings was long enough to
carry across the web only twice. In the majority of our
plain-weave cloths it was carried across three times;
in over a fifth of the total number of intact ends in the
16- lot the loomstring carried across four times. The frequencies
of two, three, and four loomstrings at the ends
of webs in this group are approximately as 6:32:16. A
number of these occurrences are on cloths in which the
heavy cord is not long enough to make a complete crossing;
the remainder of the breadth is completed with
weft of the size used for the regular weaving.</p>

<p>In the Chincha 4- lot, loomstrings of from 2- to 12-ply
formed the weft for from two to six courses of weaving.
In seven of the twenty-four specimens showing
finished ends, the loomstring stopped partway across its
course in the web and was there joined to the regular
weft yarn. In two the joining was effected by finger knots,
in the other by splicing (?). The two specimens (4-3889c
and 4-4029) having strong 12-ply loomstrings were small
but complete cloths which had been doubled and stitched
along the sides to form bags. The loomstrings thus served
to reinforce the open mouth of the bag.</p>

<p>In eleven specimens the loomstrings had an initial S
and final Z twist; twelve show the opposite combination.
In one specimen (4-4056) the separate plies have an S

<p>There are three times as many weavings with complete
widths as with complete lengths; 60 as compared
to 20. Clues to the wrappings or blankets of which these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
breadths were sections are frequently furnished by traces
of stitchery and broken threads on the side selvages. As
shown by <a href="#table2">table 2</a> and <a href="#i_019">figure 3</a>, the five narrowest complete
breadths (Group 1) are within a range of 4 to 12
inches. Narrow widths can be woven most rapidly on the
backstrap loom. Complete breadths in Group 2 (18 specimens)
fall within the range of 14 to 20 inches. These
widths, also, can be woven without much effort. Seaming
together narrow breadths appears to have been preferred
to weaving wider ones equal to the two or three which
compose some of the rectangular specimens.</p>

These widths reduce weaving speed and bring about
problems in manipulation of the loom parts. The twelve
widest complete breadths in the Chincha lot range from
30 inches to 35 inches with a single specimen measuring
41 inches. For this last piece, and possibly for several

<p>Side selvages strengthened by any one of the several
methods we know from commercial weavings are rare
in textiles from primitive looms. It is not uncommon,
however, to find four or five edge yarns drawn more
closely together than are the others in the web. Familiarity
with these two facts made our discovery of a
unique selvage finish a matter of unusual interest. The
edges of specimens 16-1228 and 16-1236 have been reinforced
by two stitchery techniques. <a href="#i_068">Plate 8</a>,<i>i</i> shows
the ordinary whipping stitches which form the foundation
for the second technique. <a href="#i_068">Plate 8</a>,<i>h</i> shows this second
line of work to consist of a double strand twined, but
always from back to front, with the tops of the whipping
stitches.</p>

<p>On one of the Chincha 4- specimens (4-4068a) the
half-inch selvage is distinguished from the body of the
fabric by the use of warp yarns lighter in color than
those appearing in the body of the fabric and by the two-over-one
weave of the right-hand selvage in contrast to
the one-over-one weave found elsewhere in the fabric.
In specimen 4-4027 the edges are strengthened on each
side for some six inches of the length by a single heavy
4-ply warp unit.</p>

<p>In the Chincha 4- specimens, where congestion of
edge yarns occurs, its extent in from the edge varies
from 5 threads (in 3 specimens) to 24 threads (1 specimen);
in the majority of these specimens, the congestion
ranges from 6 to 12 threads (8 specimens). Textures in
<a href="#i_064">plate 4</a>,<i>a</i>, <i>c</i> are comparable to those in which maximum
congestion occurs.</p>

<h2>YARNS</h2>

<p>All yarns are initially spun as single plies. In the
ancient Peruvian textiles, there are evidences of preferences
for single-ply yarns or at least the use of them
even in fabrics we should consider called for heavier
elements. The Chincha domestic cloths are good examples.
We made yarn analyses on half of the total number
of cloths in the study. All but ten of the fifty-seven
examined were woven with single-ply warp and weft
elements and of these ten, only one coarse cloth had
2-ply warps and wefts; the remaining nine had 2-ply
warps crossed by single-ply wefts. The majority of these
fabrics classified as "fine" weavings.</p>

<p>Yarns may be twisted (spun) in two directions. The
spirals formed by twisting may extend upward to the
left (the S-twist) or to the right (the Z-twist). The frequencies
of the left and the right twist in yarns are indicative
of motor habits, if nothing more.</p>

<p>The largest Chincha group comprises twenty-nine
cloths in which the warp and weft elements have left
spirals; a much smaller group (5 specimens) shows
yarns with right spirals. Two other groups (6 and 3
pieces, respectively) have warps with left spirals
crossed by wefts with right spirals and vice versa. The
other cloths in which yarns with different twists are
combined perhaps may represent the use of odds and
ends of yarns. The following combinations were found:</p>

<p>1. Single-ply S-twist and Z-twist warps crossed by
single-ply S-twist wefts (2 specimens) or crossed by
single-ply Z-twist wefts (1 specimen).</p>

<p>2. Single-ply S-twist warps crossed by single-ply
S-twist and Z-twist wefts (1 fine-texture specimen).</p>

<p>Yarns are characterized as soft- or slack-twist,
medium-twist, hard- or tight-twist, with various intermediate
degrees depending upon the angle taken by the
spiral in relation to a vertical axis. A 25-degree angle,
for example, characterizes a medium-twist yarn tending
toward hard-twist. Yarns with 30-degree to 45-degree
angles of twist are hard-twist yarns. More than half of
an unselected sample of twenty yarns fell within the
25-degree to 45-degree range. The remaining seven had
angles from 50 degrees to 90 degrees in some sections
of their lengths. An idea of the variations in any one
weaving element may be gained from <a href="#i_064">plate 4</a>,<i>c</i> and the
enlarged section of fabric in <a href="#i_067">plate 7</a>,<i>c</i>.</p>

<h2>TEXTURES AND WEAVING TECHNIQUES</h2>

<p>In general, the Chincha weavings are smooth and
closely woven (pls. <a href="#i_063">3</a>,<i>b</i>, and <a href="#i_064">4</a>,<i>b</i>). There appears to have
been little or no interest in varying the textures by employing
yarns of different weights, although the usual irregularities
to be noted in lengths of hand-spun yarns are
also evident in these. Counts taken on the warps and
wefts per inch give a fair indication of the textures, but
these are to a degree dependent upon the spinning.</p>

<p>In terms of weaving units, whether single yarns or

<a href="#i_032">Figure 5</a> shows this concentration within the frame.</p>

<p>Weaving techniques, other than the basic structural
types, are few in number. Drawing in colored warps for
stripes is a preliminary to the actual interlacing of
the elements. The results of this procedure can best be
discussed under the heading "Pattern."</p>

<p>The join is a technical feature that indicates standards
of craftsmanship. It is customary in weaving materials
with end as well as side selvages to give more or less
attention to the closing of the space between the weaving
proper and the heading strip. When the warps in
the form of a skein had been spread out evenly and
bound in place to the end bars, the ancient weavers on
two-bar looms first wove a shallow heading strip to
secure the warps in their positions and to establish the
ultimate width of the fabric, a practice followed by
some modern weavers today. Then the weaver reversed
the loom end for end to begin what became the weaving
proper, and continued until the length was complete.
Difficulties or indifference to appearance very often resulted
in a general looseness of texture where standard-size
tools had to be removed and the interlacing done
more or less by the fingers. <a href="#i_062">Plate 2</a>,<i>a</i>, <i>b</i> shows heading
strips of different depths, fairly wide join areas in
which the wefts are more widely spaced, and above these,
the compact texture of the weaving proper.</p>

<p>Three finely woven cloths, one of them shown in <a href="#i_065">plate 5</a>,<i>d</i>,
exemplify warp locking, end-to-end. This technique
is known from the earliest periods on the coast in the
so-called patchworks from Nazca Valley graves. It occurs
also in Middle- and Late-period textiles.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
methods of lengthening the warps by the addition of
new ones vary, but one feature is common to all those
examined: the supplementary transverse yarns are in
effect scaffold or skeleton wefts.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In the Chincha cloths,
the two warps interlock as shown in the reconstruction
in <a href="#i_065">plate 5</a>,<i>a</i>. In two Chincha plain-weave cloths, as in
the Nazca patchworks, the warps of two colors meet
on the skeleton weft.</p>

<p>Two specimens in lot 4- (3890a and 4056) are poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
in quality of craftsmanship. Careless weaving resulted
in the breaking of several warps, uneven shedding, and
puckering in the center of the web. A three-inch difference
in the length between the two side edges of specimen
4-4056 was probably due to slanting of the warping
stakes (<a href="#i_035">fig.6</a>). There is also a difference between the
widths of the ends of each cloth, in one of them as much
as three inches. Different weights of yarn are used, their
twists ranging from soft-to-medium to crepe.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>4-4056</b></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 6. Diagram of a web showing an irregular shape
which may have resulted from careless warping. Occurrences
of plain-weave variations are indicated by symbols
for units: <img src="images/sym2.png" alt="one-by-one" />, one-by-one; <img src="images/sym4.png" alt="one-by-two" />, one-by-two; <img src="images/sym1.png" alt="two-by-one" />, two-by-one;
and <img src="images/sym3.png" alt="two-by-two" />, two-by-two (27 in. × 26 in. over all).</p>
</div>

<p>In specimen 4-3890a the warps were grouped in
pairs throughout the breadth of the cloth. In the first
eight and one-half inches of the length, the weft is
single and for the remaining fifteen and one-half inches
the wefts are paired. This results in plain-weave variations
of two-by-one, or semibasket weave, and two-by-two,
or basket weave.</p>

<p>In setting up the loom for specimen 4-4056, twelve
inches of the breadth were warped with units of single
2-ply warp yarns (<a href="#i_035">fig.6</a>, right) and the remaining fourteen
inches were set up for units of twin warps (<a href="#i_035">fig.6</a>,
left). Several plain-weave variations were found. The
weaver introduced single and twin wefts at irregular
intervals throughout the length of the cloth. Therefore,
in the portion where the single warp unit interlaces with
single wefts, a simple one-by-one, or plain weave results;
where the single warp unit interlaces with twin
wefts, a one-by-two, or semibasket weave occurs. In
the portion of the breadth where warps are paired, interlacings
of two-by-one, or semibasket weave, and
two-by-two, or basket weave, occur.</p>

<p>Owing to the difference in length between the two
side edges of specimen 4-4056, the weaver started
making adjustments before she had woven half the
length of her cloth. In order to restore a working edge
at right angles to her warps, she introduced incomplete
or fill-in wefts; that is, weft yarns entered on the long
side and carried a distance across the web and then
turned back in the next shed (<a href="#i_068">pl. 8</a>,<i>a</i>). The largest number
of fill-in wefts occurs roughly at a point about a
third up from the end. Here, seven wefts were introduced,
one after the other, all entering from the same
side of the web (<a href="#i_065">pl. 5</a>,<i>e</i>). The distance across the web
that these various wefts were carried ranges from ten
to twenty inches. At each turning point of the weft there
is a kelim slit.</p>

<h2>STITCHERY</h2>

<p>Three very familiar needle techniques occur on the
Chincha plain-weave cloths. Breadths are seamed together
with whipping stitches or running stitches, or are
laced together with the antique seam, often called the
baseball stitch (<a href="#i_068">pl. 8</a>,<i>d</i>). The effects vary with the depth
and tightness of the seaming. Some of the whipping
stitches are left loose so the two breadths lie flat,
their selvages barely touching; other stitches are drawn
so tightly that the selvages form a ridge (<a href="#i_065">pl. 5</a>,<i>b</i>). The
smallest stitches are taken under two or three warps
less than one-eighth inch deep and about one-eighth
inch apart. Deeper stitches found on the coarse wrappings
and one bag (4-3889) range from a quarter-inch
to three-eighths of an inch in depth and the same distances
apart.</p>

<p>The baseball stitch, if well done, can bring the selvages
of two breadths together in a flat seam (<a href="#i_065">pl. 5</a>,<i>d</i>).
The Chincha types range from very loosely drawn to
tightly drawn threads.</p>

<p>Running and double running stitches (<a href="#i_068">pl. 8</a>,<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>), never
very carefully executed on the plain-weave specimens,
fasten down all the patches, hems, and occasionally the
edges of lapped seams in which one breadth is extended
conspicuously over another. Specimen 16-1229 has such
a seam with a six-inch overlap. When running stitches
are small, they range from one-eighth to one-quarter
inch in length with approximately the same distance between
them. Many more are from one-quarter to one-half
inch long, especially on the numerous patches
(<a href="#i_063">pl. 3</a>,<i>d</i>), and the distances between the stitches may be
even longer. When running stitches are used for the
hems, the cloth edges, including selvages, are turned
under twice, just as is our customary procedure.
Double running stitches on a bag (4-3889c) are about a
quarter-inch long.</p>

<p>Because of the variety of uses to which running
stitches are put, they outnumber the other types two to
one in the 16- lot, being often combined with the whipping
and baseball techniques.</p>

<p>Needleknitting, a decorative stitch which occurs frequently
on Cahuachi (Early Nazca) textiles<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is the edge
finish on four of the Chincha plain-weave cloths (<a href="#i_065">pl. 5</a>,<i>c</i>).
From the side, the stitch resembles a whipping stitch
except for its compactness and the fact that the lines of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
thread are upright, not slanting; from the edge, the
stitch resembles a chain (<a href="#i_068">pl. 8</a>,<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>). The Chincha variety
differs slightly from that on the Early Nazca textiles:
stitches taken straight over the edge alternate with
those linked together with the chain effect.</p>

<h3>Patching and Mending</h3>

<p>Any form of repair technique in Peruvian textiles
is rare. Many of the materials show wear and occasionally
coarse stitches are put through the cloth to draw
the edges of a tear together; otherwise there is little
to suggest concern with prolonging the life of a garment.</p>

<p>In a series of Chincha domestic cloths there are
eleven patched specimens but not one trace of reweaving
as in darning techniques. Apparently the unusual number
of mended cloths interested the collectors in the field
for, although a half dozen fragments appear to have been
reduced to their present size, the patched portions have
been carefully preserved. Fragmentary lengths of these
textiles ranged from 14 to 28 inches; widths ranged from
13 to 30 inches.</p>

<p>Certain generalizations are pertinent to all the mended
fragments. There is no evidence of the use of a cutting
tool; the edges of the patching pieces were torn or
snagged along a thread. If the selvages were somewhat
worn, the seamstress did not remove them but made a
deep turn to fold the worn part to the underside. Much
of the patching material was perceptibly worn to begin
with; three brown specimens were badly disintegrated.
On specimen 16-1259 there are four overlapping layers
of patching material in one spot. Generally, the worn
spot covered by a patch or several patches is an area in
which the weaving was poorly done.</p>

<p>The patched fabrics are in the medium- and coarse-texture
groups with the exception of one fine cloth (16-1224).
The repair materials fall within all three texture
groups. A third of the patches (11 out of 31) were of
striped materials, most of which are of better quality
than the base fabric. Patches too small to cover the entire
worn area are pieced out by overlapping them with
a second piece of material. More than a third of the
patches were taken from the edges of the breadths, as the
stripes indicate.</p>

<p>Techniques used to fasten down the edges are hemming
and whipping. The workmanship is fairly coarse,
the lengths of the individual stitches approximately a
quarter-inch long. Standards were much below those
held by the weaver, but this difference is not surprising.</p>

<p>Threads employed for the patching suggest that the
seamstress used odds and ends of weaving yarns. Two
or more kinds ordinarily appear on a single patch, one
of them usually a coarse white cotton thread of fairly
loose twist. Some threads are used single in the needle,
some double. Colors are browns, blues, orange, yellow,
the last happening to be short lengths of wool. There is
no evidence that the seamstress attempted to match the
yarn to either the ground or the patch materials. Where
we start a new length of thread with a knot made at the
end, these Chincha threads begin with a half-hitch around
the first stitch taken through the cloth (16-1238) or with
a stitch through the cloth and a knot tied with the short
and long sections of the thread (16-1261).</p>

<p><a href="#i_063">Plate 3</a>,<i>d</i> shows one of the typical patched cloths.
Four fabrics are represented: the base material, medium
fine; and the three patching fabrics, the lower patch
very fine and the upper right and left patches coarse.
The most complicated arrangement of patches is found
on a specimen (16-1240) composed of two breadths
seamed together. The overall measurements of the torn
rectangular fragment are 17 inches warpwise by 30
inches weftwise. Within this area are nine different
pieces of cloth, seven of them covering worn spots or
poorly woven areas.</p>

<h2>PATTERN</h2>

<p>The only colored decoration on the Chincha domestic
cloths is in the form of stripes. This section presents
an analysis of the types found on thirty-odd specimens.</p>

<p>Stripes in this sample group either border the edge of
the cloth or make an allover pattern. With the exception
of four cloths, the stripes are warpwise of the materials;
these four have stripes both warpwise and weftwise, and
thus may be classified as plaids. Edge stripes occur in
combination with an allover strip pattern in specimen
16-1287 and in combination with plaid in specimen
4-3973d (<a href="#i_066">pl. 6</a>,<i>f</i>). There are no cloths crossbanded only
with colored wefts.</p>

<p>Apparently there was no preference as to the texture
most appropriate for patterning by stripes; both fine
and coarse cloths are thus decorated. For example,
specimen 16-1225 is very fine (thread count, 102 warps
by 42 wefts per in.) and specimen 16-1234 is medium
coarse (count, 36 warps by 28 wefts per in.). Both cloths
are allover striped. Edge stripes occur on a relatively
fine cloth, specimen 16-1255a (count, 62 warps by 40
wefts per in.), and also on a coarse cloth (count, 28 warps
by 24 wefts per in.).</p>

<p>Five cloths in the Chincha lot are allover striped.
One (16-1252) has solid blue and brown stripes at irregular
intervals. The arrangement contrasts with the
regularity of the other allover-striped materials and
of the symmetrical plaids. Other allover stripes (<a href="#i_051">fig. 8</a>,
<i>a</i>; <a href="#i_067">pl. 7</a>,<i>c</i>) have units a quarter-inch wide, brown on
a neutral ground. There is both color and texture interest
in these specimens. The brown warp units are in
pairs, the neutral-color warp units between each two
brown units are alternately all single warps and all
pairs of warps. As a result, every other neutral-color
stripe is appreciably thinner than its neighbor stripes
(<a href="#i_067">pl. 7</a>,<i>c</i>). The third allover striped specimen (16-1224)
is alternately blue and neutral color, each stripe unit
approximately one-sixteenth inch wide (<a href="#i_051">fig. 8</a>,<i>c</i>). Specimen
16-1225 has striping in the same colors and to it
is seamed a piece with blue on a reddish-orange ground.
The blues appear to have been the same, but the cloth,
otherwise in good condition, is so badly faded that the
photograph does not reveal the stripes in the blue-orange
section (<a href="#i_065">pl. 5</a>,<i>d</i>). The fourth allover-stripe pattern is
common to two specimens, one of them shown in <a href="#i_051">figure 8</a>,<i>b</i>.
The colors blue and tan stand out from a neutral
ground. The sequence is blue-blue-tan, blue-blue-tan,
and repeat. The stripes measure one-sixteenth inch in
width and are about the same distance apart.

<p>The four fragments symmetrically plaided with an
identical arrangement of warp and weft stripes (16-1279;
16-1303) probably came from the same cloth despite
the different numbers.</p>

<p>Edge stripes, the most numerous group, vary in width
from three-sixteenths inch to one and three-eighths inch.
They are simple in construction, eight of the thirteen
being symmetrical both in arrangement and count of
colored warps. The semblance of balance is marked, also,
in those stripes which are not symmetrical.</p>

<p>The edge stripes with two exceptions (16-1260, a kerchief,
and full breadth 16-1287) border only one of the
selvages on the complete widths analyzed for this section.
The opposite selvages have hanging threads, remnants
of the stitchery which originally seamed two
breadths together. The stripes decorated the outside
edges of this seamed rectangle.</p>

<p>No specimen in the Chincha plain-weave group has
stripes showing more than three colors, exclusive of the
color of the ground material. The ground color is usually
neutral and may originally have been white or brown cotton.
The most frequently occurring color in the stripes
is brown, followed by blue. Red and rose occur only
twice.</p>

<p>In five specimens we found the warps used in pairs.
In specimens 16-1224 (<a href="#i_045">fig. 7</a>,<i>a</i>) and 16-1280 (<a href="#i_045">fig. 7</a>,<i>k</i>)
the colored warps are paired, the ground is set up with
single warps; in 16-1240 (<a href="#i_045">fig. 7</a>,<i>j</i>), the stripe warps and
certain sections of the ground warps are paired, the
greater portion is set up with single warps. In several
specimens the otherwise uniform setup of single colored
warps is broken by a warp unit comprising a pair (<a href="#i_045">fig. 7</a>,<i>f</i>),
and in two specimens (cf. <a href="#i_045">fig. 7</a>,<i>d</i>) the series of
single warps is broken by two pairs of warps in one of
the stripes. These units may have been deliberately
planned by the weaver, since they are maintained for
the entire length of the preserved stripe.</p>

<p>All of the Chincha striped cloths examined for this
study were woven either in the over-one-under-one interlacing
or its variation, twin warps crossed by single
weft, a technique sometimes designated as the semibasket
weave. What textural differences there are between
the colored stripes and the ground material are
the results of combining the single-warp plain weave
with its twin-warp variation. The following tabulation
shows the occurrences of these two techniques among
the thirteen striped pieces in <a href="#i_045">figure 7</a>:</p>

<h2>COLOR</h2>

<p>Fifty-odd yarns, samplings from the striped and plain
cloths of the Chincha lots, were matched against the
printed samples in Maerz and Paul's <i>Dictionary of
Color</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We found yarns corresponding to thirty-two
samples representing five of the eight color groups. We
found no dyed yarns in these cloths for colors in the
yellow-to-green, the blue-to-red, and the purple-to-red
groups. Only four yarns out of three hundred and fifty
matched in a previous study,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> corresponded to colors
in the purple-to-red group and these four matched very
dark samples on plate 56. The available evidence indicates
either that the ancients had not developed dyestuffs
to produce such hues as our fuchsias, magentas, and
heliotropes or that they did not favor these colors.</p>

<p>Over a dozen yarns matched samples on plates 14 and
15 of the orange-to-yellow groups; as many more matched
the browns on plate 37. Some of the yarns in this series
are darker than any of the printed samples on plate 39.
The third largest series, approximately twenty, match
eight samples in the blue-green-to-blue group. The fewest
number represent the green-to-blue-green group. Yarns
in four cloths are similar to poplar and bottle greens.</p>

<p>Stripes are in one, two, or three colors (<a href="#i_051">fig. 8</a>). Most
of the one-color stripes (approximately 10) are blue
(37F3, 37I5), one is an orange-red (5K10), and one clay
color (14F8). For the two-color stripes we were able to
distinguish blue (37F3), golden browns (approximating
15A12), and orange reds (approximating 5K10). In only
one of the six two-color examples, however, were the two
colors sufficiently clear to match the printed samples.
Specimen 16-1251 combines brown (15A12) and blue
(38C3) stripes.</p>

<p>The three-color stripes in the 16- lot were similarly
difficult to match with the samples in the Dictionary.
Yarns from the four specimens matched samples as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hanging">
16-1268: yellow (10C7) and two browns
(14L10, 15A12)</p>

<p class="hanging">16-1277: two yellows (11K8 and one other
darker than any in the group) and
blue (36F6)</p>

<p class="hanging">16-1283: yellow (9J5), blue (35D4), and one
other color too dull to match any
printed sample in the blue group</p>

<p class="hanging">16-1287: yellows and browns (7C12, 11K6,
and 14F6)</p>
</div>
<p>One three-color specimen in the 4- lot (<a href="#i_066">pl. 6</a>,<i>f</i>) has
a number of well-preserved portions. The weaving
proper is natural-color white cotton with plaiding in
dark brown (15C12) and gray similar to adobe (14D7).
The wide edge stripe has the same dark brown, a lighter,
more golden brown (14D12), and central pinkish stripes
which approximate printed samples 3C10 or 3C11.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

<p>Analyses of over a hundred plain-weave cloths in the
Max Uhle collection from Late-period sites at Chincha
form the material of this report.</p>

<p>The utilitarian character of most of the cloths is
conspicuous. A few plain-weave fabrics undoubtedly belong
to garments of the better type, although these specimens,
too, are without decoration except for stripings.</p>

<p>Measurements and textures suggest that some weavings
may have been mantles or other large wrappings.
All the intact ends have the customary Peruvian selvages
with heavy loomstring wefts. Intact single breadths range
in widths between 4 inches and 41 inches. The wider
breadths suggest that the loom upon which these specimens
were woven was not the type ordinarily attached to
the weaver's waist.</p>

<p>Smooth textures and the uniformly good edges indicate
that the weaving yarns were of the high quality we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
have learned to expect in the ancient cloths. Thread
counts show a wide range, as shown in <a href="#i_032">figure 5</a>.</p>

<p>Technical features in these plain cloths are the standard
ones in most respects. Warp locking of the end-to-end
variety and a unique finish on a side selvage are the
most noteworthy deviations from the norm. Perhaps the
least expected feature is the patching of weak or worn
spots in the cloths. In their present condition, the several
repaired examples reveal hard wear subsequent even
to the patching.</p>

<p>Ornamentation in the Chincha plain-weave cloths analyzed
for this study consists solely of stripes and
plaids; an occasional edge finish is as much a strengthening
device as a decorative detail. A few cloths are allover
striped; a greater number are bordered on one
edge with a series of colors, mainly yellow, browns, and
blues.</p>

<p>The group as a whole represents the many fabrics
which must have been woven solely for ordinary wear
or use, being used later as grave wrappings.
